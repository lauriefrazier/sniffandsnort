## Final Project
### Sniff and Snort

For my final project, I wanted to create a user interface to use Nmap and Snort.
Using the Streamlit framework and open source API's for Snort and Nmap, it will create a input of an IP Address into a
interactive table. This table will be able to use Snort's flagging system of intrusion and severity of attack.
